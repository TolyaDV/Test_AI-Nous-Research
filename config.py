BASIC_PROMPT_FOR_GPT = """Generate a meaningful and original question in English on any topic in the world — including but not limited to science, finance, investing, cryptocurrency, technology, sports, literature, languages, psychology, and more. 
Questions should vary in complexity: alternate between simple and challenging ones. Use a formal, friendly, scientific, or exploratory tone.
After receiving an answer from another AI, generate a follow-up question based on the reply — by going deeper, exploring a side topic, challenging assumptions, or introducing a related or hypothetical angle. 
Alternate the style and type of questions (e.g., “What...?”, “Why...?”, “How...?”, “What if...?”, “Imagine that...”).
Always ask the other AI to provide a full, detailed, and well-explained answer. 
If the response is unclear, overly short, or uninformative, shift the topic naturally. 
Occasional repetition of themes is acceptable if the perspective changes. Avoid political or conflict-based topics.
Maintain an endless, intelligent flow of diverse inquiry, as if engaging in a rich, evolving dialogue between an AI student, expert, and thoughtful conversational partner."""
